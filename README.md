# AI-portfolio

This website is made completely using AI. Specifically Calude 3.5 sonnet by Anthropic. The only thing I did was write useful promots and integrate the different components and pages.

### Essence of the project

This project is made as an example, that 'non frontend developers' like me, can show thier work off by creating a website using LLMs.    
We shouldn't shy off from using whatever tools we have to showcase our product to the market. If you're not specially a frontend developer, how you made the site doesn't even matter that much.

## Understanding the codebase

- The codebase mainly consists of 3 main HTML files.   
- Then there are two folders, one for the images used and one for the games.   
- There is no seperate CSS or JS file as the LLM used outputs code written in a single HTML life. I could have changed that but that felt against the spirit of the project.   

### Key features

I tried adding the most animations and responsiveness I could.    
Some key highlights are:
- Animations performed as the elements come in view
- Timeline effect
- Games! a lot of games!
- Mildly responsive
- Minimal but nice footer
- Consistent design
